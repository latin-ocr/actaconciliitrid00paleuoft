viii PREFACE.

Italicum, p. ⁴210, where he gives a short account of
his visit to it, says—etsi haud libero &merorum aditu
Bibliotheca frequentetur. He was, however, allowed
to take a hasty view of the Greek MSS, which he
found had suffered abstraction to ‘she number of 500
articles by dishonest porters, who sold them. Profes-
sor RANKE‚ by the Preface to his History qftlte Popes‚
appears to have had pretty free access to it}

In my Illemoirs qs the Coancil qf Trent, drawn up,
in its third, last, and most important convocation,
principally from the Acta of Paleotto, Ileft the reader
to form his own uninfluenced judgment of the merits
of the work; satisfied, that the representation there
given would speak sufficiently in its commendation,
Ι can trust to such a procedure with still stronger
confidence, in the present publication of the original,
entire. For a compendious account of the work, I
may refer to the Prefaee to those Menioirs, where a
general description is given of the whole collection of
manuscript sourceS, which supplied the main substance
of my history. It is only necessary here to state, that
the whole, including the Acta before us, of course,

¹ To the Index Bibliothecae Barbarian„ 1681, is prefixed a Breve
of Clement IX„ Motu proprio, Romae, Maii 17, 1669, which contains,
preniising its necessity in point of conscience, an indult to the pos-
sessor and librarian, and their successors, to have, read, and keep he-
retical and condemned books—a security for that right by a precise
aud verbose technicality—-and au express provision that it should be
used Secretly, and without scandal, or danger—secreto et sine aliorum
scandalo, ac periculo, retineantur. If this catalogue had contained
the MSS of the library, I should have hoped to light upon that of
Paleotto, the Acta Camilia· Tridentini. It has, however, an ample
collection of his printed works.
