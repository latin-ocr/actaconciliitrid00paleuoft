PREFACE. ix

formed a part of the magnificent manuscript stores
collected by the late Earl of Guilford. The MS. with
which we are now particularly concerned, contains
1158 pages on folio paper3 and is written with fair
legibility. There appear to be in it three different
and successive hand-writings. Supposing this to be
the fact, the third commences at page 219, and al-
though, apparently from haste of the transcriber, and
more frequent contraction, less legible, is yet written
by an individual of evidently more scholarship than
his predecessors3 and his mistakes are seldom blun-
ders. The scribe for the time, or his original (for we
must not throw all upon the negligence of transcri-
bers, as is too often both unjustly and ungenerously
done), has been particularly and inexcusably deficient
in attention to orthography and pun&tuition—&peci—
ally the latter, where the errors are often palpable, and
quite insufferable. For what appears in that respect,
therefore, I take upon mysclf the whole responsibility,
and leave the reader at full liberty to accept or correct,
as he may feel qualified. In the proper names both
of persons and places the errors are abundant. Words
are often united or disunited improperly, although
generally, if not universally, where the words given
are proper Latin words. Prepositions‚ for instance,
are frequently united with, or severed from, other
words, in manifest violation of the necessary sense.
False concords, and confusion of singular and plural,
not to add, imperfect sentences, which, however, often
escape the original writer, are of familiar occurrence.
