PREFACE. xi

is any other in manuscript equal to it. Its value, if
by nothing else, is convineingly attested by the very
large use made of its eontents both by Pallavicino¹
and Raynaldus—espeeially the latter. These two
compilers were fairly respectable, and more faithful,
to all appearance, than their circumstances might pro-
mise. But it is a plain impossibility to depend upon
the fidelity of any Romanist, wherever the supposed
interest of his ehurch is eoncerned. And the tempta-
tion to transgress is inereased in the ratio of his proxi-
mity to the centre of his spiritual universe? No other

¹ From the twenty-eighth chapter of the ‘ Life of Sarpi,’ already
cited, it appears, that sor the matter of his bulky and hasty work
Pallavicino was chiefly indebted to the labours of the Jesuit 'l'erenzio
Alciato, his predecessor in the imposed task of answering the for-
midable Venetian consultor and historian.

² No very rigid adherence to veracity could be expected in a
Church which, by her canonized authorities, allows such liberties as
the Roman does, with the most sacred of obligations, that of an oath.
With every honest, intelligent, and consistent Romanist it must be a
fundamental and paramount maxim—Salus (and even conzmodzzm)
Ecclesiae Romam suprema less. All the rest follows. But there
wants not express and the highest authority to the same effect. See the
Angelic Doctor‚ in his oracular work Summa T leealnyim, Seedf· secam
q. 89, art. 9. 3, et ad. 3.‚ Ed. Paris, 1639, p. 198. and represented
in the leeoloy. Illor. et Doym. of Dar-vs, ed. 1832, ἰν. pp. 154—183‚

ticularly cuusoe tollentes obliytttt'mzem juramenti, 120—122. But this
is not the place for expatiating in a field which has no moderate
bounds. The doctrine of the Roman Church de Mendacio is another,
allied, and not very limited field.
