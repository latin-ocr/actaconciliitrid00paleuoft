solution can be imagined of the fact, that the expressed
desire of so respectable a member of the papal church,
and so able a writer, indeed apologist, as Paleotto,
should have remained unfulfilled up to the present
century, the third nearly complete ‘3 and then fulfilled,
not by his own church, but by one of a church which
he and his execrate! The case is not at all mended,
if, as may be reasonably conjectured, he, himself, after
his subsequent elevation, and new light with it, ac-

the Councss, the publication of its proceedings in any way, without the
Pope’s authority—sine authoritate nostra—was strictly and effectually
prohibited : and in order the more completely to secure this object, as
well as render the public patient under the want, or delay, of such
desirable informati0n‚ the accredited printer¹> and publisher of the
Canons and Decrees, Paolo Mfflmtio, was allowed, or instructed, to
announce, in the most distinct and formal manner, that the remaining
Acts of the Council, with all the particulam, would shortly appear
in such a shape that nothing should be left to be desired—mox ita
emittuntur ut, &c. ; and the reader is bid to expect immediately the
entire history—universam . . historiam . . propediem expecta, The
expectation thus excited is confirmed by a writer of some authority,
Francis Lombard, a Neapolitan‚ secular theologian at the Councss, and a
friend of Seripando, in a letter to another of the Legates, Hosius, dated
vii. Id. J anuar. 1564. J am Summus Pontifex—he writes-mandavit
patrono meo, ut curam habeat imprimendae Synodi Tridentinae, quae

The intention may have been real at the time. The well-informed
biographer of Pao'lo Sarpi, who prepared the last Italian edition of his
Council of Trent‚ writes on this subject: Benche fosse costume
antico, pubblicando i canoni de’ sinodi, di aggiungervi anco gli atti, o
vogliam dire i documenti istorici e le discussioni de’ padri 3 per quello
di Trentoi pontefici romani erano interessati‚ troppo pit1 che non

avrebbono voluto far credere, a nasconderli al mondo, ed usarono
ogni arte per farne sparire sino le ultime tracce. Bioq. dc· Sarpi,
