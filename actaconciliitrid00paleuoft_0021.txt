PREFACE. xiii

case he possibly did not even correct his own MS„
at least not duly prepare it for the press.¹ Even the
selected extracts from his Acts by the Apologist‚ and
the Annalist, are indisputably to be ascribed to the
necessity, under which they both felt themselves placed
by the History of Paolo Sarpi, of fabricating a coun-
teraction, not in the usual style of straightforward and
palpable falsificatiom but with as much verisimilitudo,
and therefore with as much authentie and honest state-
ment of fact, as their cause could afford, and turn to
its own benefit. Unsupportcd opposition or point-
blank denial would hardly prosper, even with the

most prejudiced of their own communion3 and posi-
tive dishonesty‚ which could never be secure a'gainst
detection, would be stark impolicy—an indiscretion
not likely to be· incurred by, or chargeable upon,
anything papal.

It might scarcely be thought ingenuous to complain

vol. ii., p. 337. From 'the fact mentioned, pp. 4⁴26‚7‚ that the Court
of Naples‚ upon a disagreement wizh nome, in addition to an edition
of Sarpi's works, threatened a reimprcssion of Le Plat's ‘ ixionmnents
of the Council.’ and on a reconciliation in 1791 forbad that reimpres-
sion, it is cvident how deep and ahiding an aver-sion Rome felt ιο the
publication of the ‘ Acts of the Council.’ In the Wactmiuvster Revmo
for 1838, vol. xxix„ pp. 146, and following, is contained an able,
and, with some exception, judicions critique on the biography referred
to. For, to account sor the failure of the Reformation in Italy, for
which adequate causes are obvious, and have been produced, by the
antipathy of south to north, is aliberty with philosophy hardly within
the endurance of even English courtesy.

¹ By a note, p. 356, it will appear that Raynaldus was as much at
a difficulty with an incorrigible passage in lale copy as Ι have been
with the same in mine. He preferred avoiding a difficulty to the at-
tempt to master it. Other instant-es to the sanic effect will occur to
the attentive reader.
