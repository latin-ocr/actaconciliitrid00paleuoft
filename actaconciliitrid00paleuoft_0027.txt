PREFACE. xvii

may likewise refer to the published Histories of the
Council which have been noticed, and particularly to
the invaluable and satisfying Blomcments of LE PLAT.
My notes are accordingly short, and principally of a
verbal character3 and the reader may be informed,
that the running title of the Session, added for his
*convenience, is the Editor's. It will be observed, that
Paleotto makes almost constant reference to another
volume of his, whether actually compiled or not, and
whether completed or not, (for the number-s· of the folia
cease early‚) of Documents relativo to the Council.
Without having examined very particularly, I still
have no doubt that the greater, or more important, part,
of these is to be found in Le Plat's collection.¹

Ι am sufficiently sensible of the imperfectiori of the
present volume, and request, as Ι confidently rely

¹ Had Ι not been deterred by the bulk of the present volume, I
should have been gratified in adding more coincident and illustrative
notes than I have done from another history of the same portion of
the Council‚ a well-written MS. copy of which I obtained from
Mr. Rodd's stock in 1838. It is thus entitled—Lo Sucech'do en el
Concilio de Tremo. Desde el ano 1561, hasta que se acalu') (Por
D. Panno GouzALEz DE MENDozA, Obispo de Salamanca: Y los
paraceres que clio en lus cosas que desde que enlm en ΤΒΕΝΤΟ, que
fue ὰ 30 de Novz'embre de dicho (1770.) From the autobiographic Vicla
therarza of Dr. J. L. VILLANUEVA„ Tom. ii.‚ Append. No. xiii. pp.
422—428, it appears, that the author had aecess to the original in
the Royal Library of Madrid. My copy is plainly Spanish, and has
151 folia ; and from the near conformity of the numbers of the folia
with those in Villanueva’s corresponding extracts, I infer, that the
two volumes are nearly co-extcnsive and identical as to contents. The
writer, who was an eminent party in the Council, has taken care to

give due prominence to his own speeches. The reader will judge

from the few specimens given towards the end what is their cha-
taeter and value.
