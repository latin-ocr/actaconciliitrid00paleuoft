PREFACE. xlx

extensive labour of repeatedly announcing the names
of the prelates, whenever their titular designation oc-
curs. The other members of the Council may be
readily learnt, if they are not mentioned by name;
such as the Presidents, AmbassadorS, Generals of Or-
ders, Doctors‚Theologians‚ &c. Indeed, to the greater
part of the editions of the Canons and Decrces of the
Council is appended a Catalogue of all the members
of the Synod at its final convention.

For the reader's convenience likcwise Ι make the
further addition of a Table of the Sessions‚ with the two
notations, as referring, both to the present particular
assembly, the third and last, and to the whole Council
(as now received), comprehending the three convoca-
tions.

The present unique and very mcritorious 110111,ι (111
the preparation of which for the press the necessary
Ι labour has been blended with a subsidiary alleviation
under a season of heavy affiiction,) will see the light
with some good effect, if, in addition to more direct
objectS, it tends to correct some specious and popular
aberrations respecting the Council of Trent. Some
apology for the encomiastic declamation of Campion
may be found in the partial and flattering reports, upon
which he was obliged, however willingly, to depend.²

¹ This commendation must of course be qualificd3 and some ex-
cuse may be made for the author in adopting the current calumnies
of his Church against its opponente, and particularly for his making

a merit of necessity by representing the dissensions of the council as
a proof of its liberty.

sponszb, the first in his collected works.
