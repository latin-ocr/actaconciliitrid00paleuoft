XX PREFACE.

The best which can be extended to Charles Butler, Esq.‚
of the nineteenth century, is, the partial quality, and in-
fluence of his professional habits.¹ But a very small
fractior] indeed can be claimed by those, who, with sin-
gular pretensions to sagacity and impartiality, and
inventing errors for others, over which a triumph could
not be difficult, defend and eulogize the Synod, on
little other foundation than crude and insufficient views
of the great contest existing at the time, and no very
clear perception, of the differenee between truth and
error, of the possibility of any importance in that dif-
ference, of the difference between erudition and learn-

Alexander GeddeS, a persecuted, but not less honour—
able and honest, member of the Romish church‚ who,
whatever his theological errors might be, has effectu-
ally stripped the Italian Council of the ornamental
plumage‚ with which its advocates, nominally Pro-
testant as well as Papal, have laboured to invest it.2

quoted :— L'assiduita dei preti e un lasso di tre secoli hanno eoperto
di un velo magagne istoriche, e noi ci siamo avvezzati a vedere quella
sinodo sotto un aspetto tutto religioso, come gli Dei mitologici la cui
remota antichita dileguava l' origine umana ς e tanto ci padroneggia
quel pregiudizio, che a malo stento possiamo persuaderci come quell’
atto memorabile e riputata di una inspirazione celeste, fosse l' effetto
