PREFACE, xxi

The British'public is now beginning to turn an at-
tention of some intensity on this subject, particularly

di moltiplicati raggiri e di una raffinata astuzia. Baby. di Stirpi, ii.
363: p. 338 would furnish a stronger passage. The book out of
which the first is taken, (the twenty-eighth,) contains an extended
comparison of the two principal historians of the Council, more to
the discredit of the Italian than is generally supposed to be his due.
But the proof is hardly to be resisted 3 and the discussion appears to
advantage when compared with that of Professor Rmxs, in his
Histmy of the Popes, on the same subject, iii. Appendzlr, pp. 56 and
following. Both the biographer of Sarpi and the historiari of the
Popes are now under the heaviest censure which the Roman pontiff

can inflict upon literature through the accredited organ of the Con-
gregation of the Index.

The testimony of another very competent witness ought not to be
withheld. And. Dudith‚ bishop of Tinia, an efficient member of the
synod, being Orator of the whole clergy of Hungary, and publicly
eulogized by Fontidonius‚ Theologuc of the bishop of salamanca, (as
appears by his Letter prefixed to the Two Orations of Dudith‚ pub-
lished at the time at the accredited press of Breseia‚) in his Excu-
satio to tlte Emperor on resignabis] Itis bislmprz'c, dated 1567, after
minutely describing, how the Pope suscwnped by number all his oppo-
nents in the Councss, proceeds thus z—In summa, in eum statum res
est adducta, istorum, qui illuc facti institutique venerant, improbitate,
non ut jam Episcoporum, sed larvarum, non hominum, sed simula-
crorum, quae nervis moventur alienis, ut Daedali statuae fuisse perhi—
bentur, concilium illud videretur. Erant episcopi illi conductitii
plerique, ut utres, rusticorum musicum instrumentum, quos, ut vocem
mittant, inflare necesse est. Nil habuit eum illo conventu Sanctus
Spiritus commercii; omnia erant humana consilia. quae in immodica,
et sane quam pudenda Pontificum tuenda dominatione consumebantur.
Cursitabant Romam nocte dieque veredarii, omnia, qnae dicta con-
sultaque essent, quam celerrime ad Papam deferebantur. Illinc re-
sponsa, tanquam Delphis aut Dodona, expectabantur: illinc nimirum
spiritus ille S. quem suis Conciliis praeesse jactant, tabellarii manticis
inclusus, mittebatur: qui, &c- A.Dun1rn11 Orate. διε. 1610, Offen-
bachi, p. 40. Of the doubtful and superfluous question of this prelate’s
subsequent lapse into Socinianism, and how long hc might continu(=
in it, the true question being his information and integrity, sce szrr—
