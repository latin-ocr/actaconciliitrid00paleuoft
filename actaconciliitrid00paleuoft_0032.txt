xxii ¹ PREFACE.

the vital and accredited documents of a foreign eccle-
siastical corporation now laying strong and regular
siege to the Church of our Fatherland. At the period
with which the Acta are concerned, circumstances, par-
ticularly the assaults directed against the Papacy, and
which could not be despised, rendered the convention
of a Council, exclusively her own, the most hopeful
expedient of defence. Her policy was not materially
mistaken. But while by this means she certainly did
consolidate her empire, and bound her subjects to their
fidelity by the strictest bonds, she at the same time,
though unconsciously, being then absorbed in the
thought of self defence‚ fixed them upon herself ; and
ages, then future, now present, have converted this
very strength into weakness—-converted it into an ex-
posure, without remedy, of those points in her system,
which are most assailable‚ which enable her assailants
to turn her own artillery upon her with irresistible
effect, and which can hardly fail in the end to prove
her demolition.

And should the present publication, by the peculi-
arity of its character, contribute to evince the fact, that
a Christianity predominantly and pervasively vitiated‚
with all the aid of secular and ecclesiastical pomp and
patronage, favoured too by every and the utmost efforts

l

of abused learning, and the flattery of interested and

capricious friends, is still unable for a moment to hold

¹ It is quite beside the point to expatiate on the peculiar learning
and eloquence of the Tridentine Fathers—that is allowed. But that
is likewise a fraction only, and an inconsiderable one, of the entire
subject, as its proper merits are coneerned.
