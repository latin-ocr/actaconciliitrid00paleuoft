PREFACE. y xxiii

up her head in the presence of any form of Christi-
anity in almost the slightest degree restored to its
original purity—more especially should the result of
the contrast and comparison, in any case admitting
the supposition‚ be, the dismissal of error and the em-
bracement of truth——not all, or simply intellectual‚
truth, but that which involves eternal and irreversible
considerations‚ and, in spite of all opposing and evad-
ing pretensions‚ dictatorial or plausible as they may be,
discovers the only rational and authoritative way by
which a race, evidently, dceply‚ and otherwise help-
lessly, guilty, can escape just and terrific recompense
at the trial, to which death delivers them over—
truth‚ in the absence of which the most approved pre-
scriptions of earthly science, with whatever ostentation
and gravity proposed, are of little greater value than
the infallible panacea of the empiric¹—should this
happiest of all results be in any degree realized‚ the
Editor will feel a joy and thankfulness far surpassing
any, which might reasonably arise from the conviction
of having presented to fellow students in the same path
of literature a new and interesting relic of human
history.

Sulton Colclfield, Jan. 1, 1842.
