Decretum Indictionis Sessionis futurae omnibus simplici-
ter placuit.¹

¹ Througbout this Session Paleotto seems to have studiously omitted any mention
of the Bp. of Sala-manca, although he was not a silent member of the council. By
his Sncedido, foll. 90, 94, it appears that he spoke three times, July 9 and 14,
on the Abuses cf Order. He has recorded his own speeches‚ which are sensible.
See before, pp. 581, 2. 1 might likewise have noticed at an earlier period, May 24,
the omission of a long speech of the Bp. of Aversa, in Campania, copied by Le
Plat, vi. 80, and following pages from Martene, Vct, Mon„ at the end of which is
a reference to the concluding Canon in the first draft of the Canons on the Abuses
of Order, in these words—De decimo septimo, videlicet (Ie forma juramenti, sum
in sententia illorum qui dixerunt, quod ad aliud differatur tempus. This is the
more worthy of observation, because Sarpi in his History‚ l. viii. x} xxii., has referred
to the enjoined oatlz, unsupported either by Pallavicino or Raynaldus, as Courayor
has observed, and, it may be added, by Paleotto or any other writer, before Martene
gave the aforesaid speech to the public. See before, the Note at p. 507.
